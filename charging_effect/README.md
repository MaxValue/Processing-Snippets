# Particle Effect

## Description

This processing snippet is an effect of mine i had in mind for long but never realized until now. The general idea is to copy the charging effect of particle/laser cannons as seen in science-fiction movies and animated tv-series.
The particles just come into the scope and as they get nearer to the focus they get faster and are being teared apart.
Just before the focus the light is bended as if there was a lense-like object. The direction of the particles in this area is inverted and the existence of this light-phenomenon is only distinguishable through the fact that the particles get slower at the edges.
